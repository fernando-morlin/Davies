Type synthesis module using Davies' method and matroid theory.

This module implements automated type synthesis algorithms that use Davies' method
to systematically enumerate and select self-aligning mechanism types.

Joint Types in Planar Mechanisms (lambda=3):
-----------------------------------------
- revolute:       1 DOF, rotation about Z-axis
- prismatic_x:    1 DOF, translation along X-axis
- prismatic_y:    1 DOF, translation along Y-axis
- pin_in_slot_x:  2 DOF, rotation + translation along X-axis
- pin_in_slot_y:  2 DOF, rotation + translation along Y-axis
- planar_trans:   2 DOF, translation along X and Y axes
- planar:         3 DOF, rotation + translation along X and Y axes
- rigid:          0 DOF, fully constrained

Joint Types in Spatial Mechanisms (lambda=6):
-----------------------------------------
- revolute_x:        1 DOF, rotation about X-axis
- revolute_y:        1 DOF, rotation about Y-axis
- revolute_z:        1 DOF, rotation about Z-axis
- prismatic_x:       1 DOF, translation along X-axis
- prismatic_y:       1 DOF, translation along Y-axis
- prismatic_z:       1 DOF, translation along Z-axis
- planar_translation_xy: 2 DOF, translation in XY plane
- planar_translation_xz: 2 DOF, translation in XZ plane
- planar_translation_yz: 2 DOF, translation in YZ plane
- spherical:         3 DOF, rotation about X, Y, and Z axes
- spatial_translation: 3 DOF, translation along X, Y, and Z axes
- rigid:             0 DOF, fully constrained

Additional custom joint types may be identified during type synthesis,
labeled with their degrees of freedom as "spatial_dofN_custom".
