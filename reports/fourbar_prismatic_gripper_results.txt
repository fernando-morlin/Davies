================================================================================

SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
Total unique mechanism types found: 1
Motion space dimension: 3 (Planar)
Original mechanism: 4 links, 4 joints
Joints: a, b, c, d

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------
Required freedoms:
  Joint a: Tx
  Joint b: Rz
  Joint c: Rz
  Joint d: Tx

JOINT TYPE REFERENCE
----------------------------------------
revolute:       1 DOF, rotation about Z-axis
prismatic_x:    1 DOF, translation along X-axis
prismatic_y:    1 DOF, translation along Y-axis
pin_in_slot_x:  2 DOF, rotation + translation along X-axis
pin_in_slot_y:  2 DOF, rotation + translation along Y-axis
planar_trans:   2 DOF, translation along X and Y axes
planar:         3 DOF, rotation + translation along X and Y axes
rigid:          0 DOF, fully constrained

DETAILED MECHANISM TYPES
================================================================================

MECHANISM TYPE #1
----------------------------------------
Joint Types:
  a     : planar_trans    (3 DOF)
  b     : revolute        (1 DOF)
  c     : revolute        (1 DOF)
  d     : prismatic_x     (0 DOF)

Mobility: -9

GRIPPER RECOMMENDATIONS:
Potential contact points: b, c
Potential actuation joints: d
Fixed connections: None

Guidance:
- For grippers, contact points should typically be revolute joints
- Linear actuation often uses prismatic joints
- Pin-in-slot joints can provide helpful degrees of freedom for self-alignment
