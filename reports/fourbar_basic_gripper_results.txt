DETAILED MECHANISM TYPES
================================================================================

MECHANISM TYPE #1
----------------------------------------
Joint Types:
  a     : pin_in_slot_y   (2 DOF)
  b     : revolute        (1 DOF)
  c     : revolute        (1 DOF)
  d     : pin_in_slot_x   (2 DOF)

Mobility: -1

GRIPPER RECOMMENDATIONS:
Potential contact points: b, c
Potential actuation joints: None
Fixed connections: None

Guidance:
- For grippers, contact points should typically be revolute joints
- Linear actuation often uses prismatic joints
- Pin-in-slot joints can provide helpful degrees of freedom for self-alignment
